Nowadays, shooting a video is an essential skill. Either you are a content creator, business owner or simply want to showcase your work. It’s true that recording a video is as simple as a click of a button. However, a lot of us still get overwhelmed with the different settings. Sometimes, not knowing the right setting will result to a poor quality video. This guide will briefly explain on how you should adjust the settings on your camera or smart phone to get the best output.

      <p>If you have either a DSLR, mirrorless camera or a smart phone, it does not matter. All the content in this documentation can be applied to all three. For smartphones, you might need to download 3rd party apps to get access to all the advanced settings. For IOS, I would suggest either ProCam or Moment. For android, I suggest using FiLMiC Pro. </p>

    <header>ISO</header>
    <article>
      <p>
ISO stands for the International Organization for Standardization — an organization that sets international standards for all different kinds of measurements. But, when in reference to your camera, the ISO is your camera’s sensitivity to light. ISO is displayed in a number like this: 100, 200, or 400. Essentially, when you adjust your ISO, you’re changing your camera’s sensitivity to light (i.e., you brighten or darken your image).
      </p>

      <p>
The ISO is how you can adjust the exposure on your camera. It’s one of the three main pillars of exposure — along with shutter speed and aperture. Changing the ISO will brighten or darken your image. When it comes to measuring the ISO, the lower the ISO, the darker your image will be; the higher the ISO, the brighter your image will be.
      </p>
      <p>
Typically the best ISO setting for video is a low ISO. An ISO between 100–200 is going to give you the best result. You’ll also want to consider your camera’s native ISOs. What are native ISOs? Well , they’re the ISOs your camera performs best at. For example, when it comes to Canon cameras, the native ISOs are 160, 320, 640, 1250, 3200, etc. It’s usually structured the same way for other cameras, too. You’ll often see that native ISOs are doubled as they increase. If you stick to native ISOs while brightening or darkening your image, you’ll notice less grain, and get — overall — a better quality image.
So, if you’re opening up your camera to shoot a video, choose a low ISO like 160 if you’re on a Canon. And then brighten up your image if you need to with shutter speed and aperture. For setting exposure, you should follow this order: ISO, then aperture, and finally shutter speed to get the best results.

  <section class="main-section" id="Frame_Rate">
    <header>Frame Rate</header>
  <article>
      <p>
Frame rate is the amount of individual video frames that your camera captures, per second. Frame rate comes in a few different standards (expressed as frames per second or fps): 24fps, 25fps, 30fps, 60fps, and 120fps. Frame rate stems from film and the very first silent films. Film would be on a reel and then cranked by hand by a camera operator, and then the projectionist would playback the film at the same frame rate that it was recorded at. You can think of frame rate like a flip book: each new drawing on a piece of paper is a frame. When you flip through, you see all the frames blended together as one continuous moving image. That in mind, if you have a frame rate of 24fps, that means in one second, the camera is capturing 24 individual frames, and when played back, it displays as one continuous video.
      </p>

      <p>
The best frame rate for video is … well, all of them! That’s because each frame rate has a specific use case. For video on the web, most TV, and film, 24fps is the standard. That’s because this frame rate is the most cinematic, and looks the most natural to the human eye. For live TV, sports, or soap operas, 30fps is common. 30fps has six more frames per second than 24fps, giving it a smoother feel that works well for live TV, but it is less cinematic. 60fps, 120fps, and higher frame rates are used for recording video to be played back in slow motion. When choosing your frame rate, you’ll want to keep in mind that the higher the frame rate, the slower the slow motion will be. For example, videos recorded in 60fps or 120fps will then be slowed down to a 24ps frame rate, which creates that smooth slow motion effect. If you ever play back a 60fps or 120fps how it is recorded, then you’ll definitely notice a strange-looking effect.

  <section class="main-section" id="Shutter_Speed">
    <header>Shutter Speed</header>
    <article>
    <p>
In photography, shutter speed has a pretty literal definition: It’s how fast the shutter opens and closes when you take a picture. When it comes to how shutter speed is measured, a lower shutter speed (e.g., 1/50) means the shutter is opening and closing at a slower rate. When your shutter is opening and closing at a slower rate, you’ll notice that your image will be bright, and fast-moving objects will be out of focus. That in mind, with slower shutter speeds, it’s best to put your camera on a tripod to minimize unintentional blur.
    </p>
    <p>
A higher shutter speed (e.g., 1/1000) means the shutter is opening and closing at a fast rate. The outcome is that your image will be darker, and fast-moving objects will be crisp and in focus. If you have a higher shutter speed, you can hold the camera in your hand — without necessarily needing a tripod.
    </p>
    <p>
Now, when it comes to shutter speed for video, it’s relatively the same, but the shutter isn’t opening and closing. What actually happens is that the shutter stays open, and the sensor exposes for a certain period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
In a nutshell, you can use any shutter speed you want when shooting a video. Think of shutter speed as a way to brighten or darken your video image. But beyond just that, you can achieve different looks with various shutter speeds for video. A lower shutter speed has a cinematic feel, and creates a more natural-looking motion blur. A higher shutter speed will feel jumpy. If you’re a shutter-speed purist, you can follow the 180-degree shutter rule! That means: Take your frame rate (30 frames per-second, for example), double it, and then round to the nearest shutter stop (1/60). Another example: Shooting in 120 frames per-second (fps)? Set your shutter speed to 1/250.

  <section class="main-section" id="Aperture">
    <header>Aperture</header>
    <article>
      <p>
      The aperture on your camera is a hole that controls how much light actually comes through the camera lens to fall on the sensor. Think of it like your eyes: When you squint, less light comes through to the pupil, and when the eye is opened fully, all of the light enters. Something to keep in mind is that the aperture on your camera not only affects the brightness or exposure of your image, but the depth of field, too. The aperture setting is typically identified by an f-number, often called an f-stop (a ratio comparing the focal length to the effective aperture diameter).
The lower the f-number, the more light will come through the lens (smaller number = larger hole). The higher the f-number, the less light will come through the lens to reach the sensor (larger number = smaller hole). Make sense?
      </p>
      
      <p>
      You can use many different apertures for video. If you’re familiar with photography, aperture for video follows the same rules you’re already familiar with. Aperture is one of the three main adjustments for exposure/brightness on your camera. The others being shutter speed and ISO. Setting the right aperture also depends to what the shutter speed and ISO are set. They all work together to create one balanced-looking shot. Aperture for video follows the same rules as aperture for photography.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Higher the number = darker the image
        </li>
        <li>
         Lower the number = brighter the image
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Most importantly, you have to consider the context: What is it that you’re shooting? Here are some examples: If your subject is running or moving a lot, then you probably want a higher aperture where more of the scene is going to be in focus, so your subject doesn’t become blurry. Now, if you’re shooting a closeup of something extremely cute and still, like a closeup of a sleeping dog, then you’ll want to crank that aperture all the way down. With a lower aperture, you’ll be able to have a dynamic depth of field in your shot.
      </p>
      <p>
      Finally, with autofocus tracking recently taking over the DSLR game, you don’t have to worry too much about your shot being in focus, but these rules above still apply for properly exposing for a shot.

The most basic lighting setup is a three-point lighting setup, which highlights the main subject and makes them stand out from their background. This setup helps create balance and a controllable distribution of light, which is essential for high-quality video production. To properly set up your lighting equipment: 
      </p>

      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Set up your key light.</b> The key light is the main—and strongest—light source in a scene or on the actor. Place this light off to one side of your subject to create a slight shadow on the opposite side of their face. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add your fill light.</b> The fill light adds dimension and softens harsh shadows created by the key light. Place your fill light on the opposite side of the subject’s face to balance unwanted contrasts or shadows
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Place your backlight.</b> The backlight goes behind the subject to help define and highlight their features and outlines. Backlight helps separate the subject from the background, creating distinct images and features.
        </li>

After you’ve recorded all your video footage it’s time to turn all those individual shots into your video. But where to start? Perhaps the most important, and lengthiest, workflow in your video production process is the editing phase, but it can be intimidating. This is where you turn all of that footage into something artfully cut together and, hopefully, watchable - maybe even viral.

Editing doesn’t have to be a challenge. Follow this checklist to ensure you’ve ticked off all the essential steps.
      </p>
      
  <ol>
    <li><b>Choose your software.</b> There’s a lot of video editing platforms out there for you to choose from; a simple search on Google will give advice on which platforms offer which benefits, which software is the easiest to edit in and how to maximize their potential. The most widely used platforms by beginners and seasoned videographers alike are Adobe® Premiere® Pro CC, iMovie and Final Cut Pro X. Depending on the hardware you’re working on, some platforms may not be supported.</li>
  <li><b>Keep your footage organized. </b>  Once you’ve imported your video clips and they’re safely housed on your device, it’s time to organize them. Make a folder for your project with a subfolder for all the raw, unedited files you’ve just transferred across. Organization will pay you back in time saved. Don’t forget to name your files, so you can recognize the sequence you’re hoping to create.
<p>
At this stage it’s also handy to delete your unwanted takes; keep only the best version of each shot to save yourself time in cutting these down the line. Be ruthless! A range of factors such as poor camera angles, quality of audio and delivery of any speech can throw your project off.</p></li>
  <li><b>Trim out the dead space.</b>  Most of your clips probably start too soon or end too late. Trim each clip down so that only the action you want to include in the final cut remains.</li>
  <li><b>Do not neglect audio.</b> All good videos have background music; awkward silences should definitely not make it to your small-screen project, unless they’re intended to build suspense. Make sure you’re using royalty-free background music to avoid any copyright issues later down the line (another great time-saving tip).</li>
  <li><b>Use b-roll to tell the story.</b> B-roll is an essential part of any final cut. It adds context to your video; it aids the transition between shots, including angle transitions and changes of scenery; and it adds that professional touch to your project.</li>
  <li><b>Captions and subtitles.</b> Accessibility is key to any video. Not every member of your audience will watch with sound. This could be a lengthy process if you’re transcribing your audio manually, but with Trint you can automatically create your captions and subtitles using powerful artificial intelligence (AI). Trint allows you to create your subtitles in a range of file formats that are easily imported into your video software, taking the hassle out of accessibility. </li>
  <li><b>Choose the right video export settings.</b>  Video exporting settings can seem like a minefield, but they’re important to know. You’ll need to export your videos to share them with the world. Each video editing software platform will have its own method of exporting, along with its own set of video exporting settings.

You’ll dictate the video format to export to and the presets, such as the bitrate of your video, which tells the software the level quality you want to export your video in.</li>
